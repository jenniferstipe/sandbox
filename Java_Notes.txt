import java.awt.*; 
import javax.swing.*;

Java comes with a set of code libraries that are designed to help programmers. 
They provide access to classes that perform specific functions, to save you the bother of having to write them yourself.

The two import statements above, let the compiler know that the application wants to use some of the pre-built 
functionality contained within the "AWT" and "Swing" code libraries.

AWT stands for “Abstract Window Toolkit”. It contains classes that programmers can use to make graphical 
components, e.g., buttons, labels, frames. Swing is built on top of AWT, and provides a new set of more 
sophisticated graphical interface components. With just two lines of code, we gain access to these graphical 
components, and can use them in the Java application.

-Import-

In dynamic languages, when the interpreter imports, it simply reads a file and evaluates it.

In Java, import is simply used by the compiler to let you name your classes by their unqualified name, 
let's say String instead of java.lang.String. You don't really need to import java.lang.* because the 
compiler does it by default. However this mechanism is just to save you some typing. Types in Java are 
fully qualified class names, so a String is really a java.lang.String object when the code is run. Packages 
are intended to prevent name clashes and allow two classes to have the same simple name, instead of relying 
on the old C convention of prefixing types like this. java_lang_String. This is called namespacing.

BTW, in Java there's the static import construct, which allows to further save typing if you use lots of 
constants from a certain class. In a compilation unit (a .java file) which declares

import static java.lang.Math.*;
you can use the constant PI in your code, instead of referencing it through Math.PI, and the method cos() 
instead of Math.cos(). So for example you can write

double r = cos(PI * theta);
Once you understand that classes are always referenced by their fully qualified name in the final bytecode, 
you must understand how the class code is actually loaded. This happens the first time an object of that class 
is created, or the first time a static member of the class is accessed. At this time, the ClassLoader tries 
to locate the class and instantiate it. If it can't find the class, a ClassNotFoundException is thrown. 
To locate the class, the ClassLoader usually checks the paths listed in the $CLASSPATH environment variable.
